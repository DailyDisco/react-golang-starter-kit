# Create Branch Name and Commit Message

I want to commit everything in my staged

What should my branch name be and what should my commit message be?

Create the branch, commit the changes I currently have staged (nothing new added to the staging area), do a build check, run tests, and push the changes to the branch.

If there are build errors or tests fail, fix them and commit the changes.

# React-Golang Starter Kit

This project is a starter kit for building full-stack applications with React (frontend) and Golang (backend). It provides a basic setup to help you get started quickly with a modern development workflow.

## Features

- **React Frontend:** Built with Vite, React Router, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI components.
- **Golang Backend:** Built with Gin framework, GORM for database interactions, and a structured project layout.
- **Docker Support:** Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend for easy containerization.
- **Database Integration:** Placeholder for PostgreSQL database integration.
